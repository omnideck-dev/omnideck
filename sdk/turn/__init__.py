"""React loop: iterative LLM-call → tool-execution cycle and turn lifecycle.

This package provides:
- ``run_turn``: Async function driving the chat/tool loop.
- ``turn_scope``: Async context manager for conversation turn lifecycle.
- Stop/nudge signaling utilities for user-initiated control.

The high-level ``TurnExecutor`` and ``Conversation`` are defined in
``sdk.turn._executor`` and re-exported from the top-level ``sdk`` package.
They are not re-exported here to avoid a load-order cycle with ``sdk.context``.
