"""Phase-typed hook system for the tool-call loop.

Each hook phase has its own typed signature — hooks receive exactly what they
need and return exactly what the loop should use to proceed.

Phase signatures:
    on_turn_start(agent_name) -> None
    async before_model(history, iteration, agent_name) -> None
    async after_model(response, history, iteration, agent_name) -> ChatResponse
    before_tool(tool_name, tool_arguments) -> str | None
    after_tool(tool_name, tool_arguments, tool_result) -> str
    on_turn_end(final_content, agent_name) -> None
