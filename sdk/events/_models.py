"""Event models for agent events and tool call notifications.

This module defines the public schema for events emitted by agents while
handling a single user message (a turn). The schema uses a discriminated
union on the ``type`` field so additional event types can be added without
breaking existing consumers.

Design notes:
- Binary payloads are represented as base64-encoded strings paired with a
  content type.
- Event payloads use a discriminator field named "type".
- AgentEvent is a thin envelope: metadata + a single typed payload.
