"""AES-256-GCM encryption for credential bundles + master-key lifecycle.

The master key is 32 random bytes generated on first boot and stored plaintext
at ``<vault>/.master-key`` with Unix mode ``0600`` (rw for owner only; group
and other get nothing). The supervisor runs as its own UID so no other process
in the container can read the file; the agent in particular runs as a
different UID and the ``0600`` mode lets the kernel refuse its reads.

``encrypt_secrets`` / ``decrypt_secrets`` use AES-256-GCM with:

- A fresh 12-byte random nonce per write (never reused under the same key).
- The integration ID as AAD — the auth tag binds the ciphertext to its filename,
  so renaming ``gmail.enc`` to ``icloud.enc`` produces a decryption failure.
- A 1-byte version header (``0x01``) reserved so a future scheme can coexist
  with the current one without ambiguity.

Only the secret bundle (auth blob) is encrypted; non-secret metadata lives
plaintext in the sibling ``.meta`` file.
