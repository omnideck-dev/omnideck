"""Top-level supervisor lifecycle: master key, registry, app.sock listener.

The :class:`Supervisor` class is what tests instantiate and what ``__main__``
will eventually wire up. It doesn't run a loop itself — the caller awaits
``start()``, does its work (or blocks on ``serve_forever`` in production), then
awaits ``stop()``.

Broker lifecycle (spawn / watch / respawn / remove) lives in
:class:`brokering.supervisor._manager.BrokerManager`. The supervisor
orchestrates startup ordering — bind the listener AFTER reconciliation so
clients never see a half-warmed registry — and delegates everything
broker-shaped to the manager.
