"""SMTP client for the email broker.

Thin async wrapper around stdlib :mod:`smtplib`. Mirrors the IMAP client's
contract:

- Every blocking call runs through ``asyncio.to_thread`` so the event loop
  stays responsive while a connection / handshake / send is in flight.
- An ``asyncio.Lock`` serializes access to the underlying ``smtplib.SMTP``
  session — ``smtplib`` is synchronous and not thread-safe, and SMTP itself
  serializes one transaction at a time per connection.

Connection lifecycle: we open one SMTP session at ``connect()`` time and
hold it open until credential replacement or shutdown. ``send_message`` reconnects
transparently on a dropped session — STARTTLS providers occasionally idle
us out after a few minutes, and a stale connection is the normal failure
shape, not a fatal one. Retired clients cannot reconnect or retry interrupted sends.
