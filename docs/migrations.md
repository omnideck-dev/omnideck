# Data Migrations

Data migrations transform on-disk state when the application is upgraded.
They run once at startup, before the server accepts requests, and require
no user interaction.

## When to use a migration

Use a migration when you need to change the shape of persisted data — renaming
fields, restructuring JSON files, populating new default data, etc.  If the
change only affects code (not stored state), you don't need a migration.

## How they work

1. The server calls `run_migrations(state_dir)` during its `on_startup` phase,
   before the HTTP server begins listening.
2. The runner loads `.migrations.json` from the state directory to see which
   migrations have already been applied.
3. It walks the `_MIGRATIONS` list in order and runs any whose name isn't in
   the applied set.
4. After each migration succeeds, its name is appended to `.migrations.json`
   so it won't run again.

Migrations are synchronous and blocking — the app won't start until they
finish.  Keep them fast.

## Broker-owned vault migrations

The app and supervisor reuse `migrations._engine.run_migration_plan`, but run
different plans under different OS identities. The app plan remains in
`migrations/_runner.py`. The vault plan lives in `brokering/migrations/` and is
invoked by `Supervisor.start()` before connection reconciliation or socket
binding. Its `.migrations.json` is inside the vault and is not the app ledger.
Importing the shared engine does not load or execute application migrations.

Vault migration `001_operation_grants` converts v1/v2 connection metadata using
frozen permission mappings. It neither reads nor decrypts credential files and
does not consult OAuth scopes or the current catalog. Ciphertext stays unchanged.
Original metadata is preserved as `creds/<id>.meta.pre-v3.bak` (including backups
from the earlier in-place upgrader). Metadata and backup writes are atomic and
owner-only; retries never replace the original backup. Existing v3 records are
left unchanged. Orphan metadata is also migrated so a later credential repair
does not reintroduce legacy records after the plan has completed.

A failed vault migration stops supervisor startup without marking it complete.
Record conversion is idempotent, so a later startup can resume partially
completed work. Unknown legacy presets or malformed metadata require repair;
they are not silently discarded or marked migrated. The completion ledger is
also written atomically with owner-only permissions.

## Adding a new migration

1. Create a new file in `migrations/`, following the naming convention
   `_NNN_short_description.py` (e.g. `_003_add_profile_version.py`).
   Define a ``migrate`` function that takes the state directory:

   ```python
   from pathlib import Path

   def migrate(state_dir: Path) -> None:
       ...
   ```

2. Register it in ``migrations/_runner.py`` by appending to the
   ``_MIGRATIONS`` list. Every migration module exports a function named
   ``migrate`` — if you imported them plainly, each new one would shadow
   the last. So import each under an alias that matches its module name,
   then append a ``(name, migrate_fn)`` tuple to the list:

   ```python
   from migrations._003_add_profile_version import migrate as _003_add_profile_version

   _MIGRATIONS = [
       ("001_task_agent_to_profile", _001_task_agent_to_profile),
       ("002_install_default_profiles", _002_install_default_profiles),
       ("003_add_profile_version", _003_add_profile_version),  # ← new
   ]
   ```

   Order matters: always append at the bottom so existing
   installations keep the same sequence.

## Guidelines

- **Back up before modifying.** If you're rewriting files, save a copy first
  (see `_001_task_agent_to_profile.py` for the pattern).
- **Be idempotent within the migration.** If a file has already been partially
  migrated (e.g. from a crash), handle that gracefully.
- **Don't import application code that has side effects.** Migrations run
  early in startup.  Importing heavy modules (LLM providers, browser tools)
  can cause problems.  Stick to stdlib + config.
- **Keep migrations fast.** They block startup.

## File layout

```
migrations/
  __init__.py                         # re-exports run_migrations
  _runner.py                          # explicit _MIGRATIONS list + applier
  _001_task_agent_to_profile.py       # example: field rename
  _002_install_default_profiles.py    # example: seed default data
```

## Tracking file

Applied migrations are recorded in `{state_dir}/.migrations.json`:

```json
[
  "001_task_agent_to_profile",
  "002_install_default_profiles"
]
```

Delete an entry from this file to re-run a migration (useful during
development).
