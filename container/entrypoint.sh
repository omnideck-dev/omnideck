# ── Shared downloads dir (computron + broker) ────────────────────────────────
# /home/computron/downloads is the landing place for files the agent
# retrieves from external sources: browser saves (written by computron via
# the browser tool) and email attachments (written by broker). Both UIDs
# need to drop files here, but only computron should have full control of
# the directory.
#
# Mode 3770 = setgid (2) + sticky (1) + 770:
#  - 770: owner rwx, group rwx, others none
#  - setgid (2): new files inherit group=broker so a file computron writes
#    is still readable by broker via group membership and vice-versa
#  - sticky (1): a process can only delete/rename files it owns. Broker
#    creates email attachments and can clean those up; broker CANNOT delete
#    or rename a file computron wrote. computron, as the directory owner,
#    can still do anything to anything (sticky exempts the dir owner).
#
# Net: broker gets enough access to drop attachments and tidy its own GC;
# computron retains full authority over the folder.
