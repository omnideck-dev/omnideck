"""Migration 001: Convert legacy task ``agent`` field to ``agent_profile``.

Legacy tasks used an ``agent`` string field (e.g. "browser", "coder",
"computron") to select which agent ran the task. This migration converts
them to the new ``agent_profile`` field that references an AgentProfile ID.

Mapping:
  - "browser"   → "research_agent"
  - "coder"     → "code_expert"
  - "computron" → "computron"

Also strips intermediate fields (``skills``, ``profile``, ``agent_config``)
that were part of a never-shipped format.

A backup of each modified goal file is saved under
``{state_dir}/.backups/001_task_agent_to_profile/goals/{goal_id}.json``.
