"""Shared env-var bootstrapping for broker entry points.

Every concrete broker reads its config from the environment the supervisor
passes at spawn time. The two primitives below keep each broker's ``__main__``
tiny and ensure a consistent contract with the supervisor:

- Missing required env var exits with :data:`integrations.brokers._common._exit_codes.GENERIC_ERROR`
  and a clear message — the supervisor turns non-auth-fail exits into the
  ``error`` state with backoff restart.
- Boolean flags are parsed fail-closed. Only the literal string ``"true"``
  (case-insensitive) is truthy, so a typo or missing flag defaults to the safe
  side when a default is genuinely safe.
