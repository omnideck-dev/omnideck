"""The ``call()`` entry point — how app-server code invokes broker verbs.

Two RPC hops in one call:

1. Resolve: ask the supervisor's ``app.sock`` for the broker's UDS path given
   an integration id.
2. Invoke: open the broker's UDS, send the verb frame, read the response.

Each hop uses the same length-prefixed JSON framing the supervisor and
brokers serve. Errors from either hop are mapped to the exception hierarchy
in ``_errors.py``.

Walking-skeleton shape: no resolve-cache, no connection pool, one UDS
connection per ``call()`` invocation. That matches what the existing tests
use and keeps the first pass small; a caching layer slots in later without
touching callers.
