class IntegrationMeta(BaseModel):
    """Non-secret metadata for one installed integration.

    Lives as plaintext JSON at ``<vault>/creds/<id>.meta`` next to the encrypted
    ``<id>.enc`` (which holds the secret bundle). Keeping the non-secret fields
    plaintext lets the supervisor list integrations, toggle permissions, and
    rebuild its registry on restart without touching the master key.

    Attributes:
        version: Schema version for forward-compat. Bump when field layout
            changes in a way that needs migration.
        id: Stable identity, formatted ``<slug>_<user_suffix>``, ``[a-z0-9_-]+``
            up to 64 chars. Not editable after creation.
        slug: Catalog entry slug (e.g. ``"gmail"``, ``"icloud"``). Selects the
            broker binary and any provider-specific config the catalog ships.
        label: Human-readable label shown in the UI. User-editable.
        permissions: Per-capability access level. The broker enforces these at
            verb dispatch — an agent bypassing the app server's tool registry
            and connecting directly to a broker's UDS still gets refused.
        path_prefix: Folder scope for CLI-exec integrations (the ``cli``
            slug) — a path, relative to the workspace root, that the
            integration's secret is confined to. ``None`` means global.
            Not a secret (just a folder name), so it's fine in plaintext
            metadata — the UI needs it to show/validate scope without going
            through the broker. The broker also gets a copy via the
            encrypted bundle at spawn time; this is the display-only mirror.
            TODO: this value is written independently of its copy inside
            the encrypted auth_blob, on every path that sets either one —
            nothing enforces they stay in sync. Worth deciding whether this
            plaintext copy should instead be derived from the vault at read
            time, before a future write path updates one without the other.
        added_at: When the integration was first added.
