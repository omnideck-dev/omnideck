"""Canonical filesystem permission policy for the integrations subsystem.

Two distinct mechanisms enforce these modes — they MUST agree:

1. **Container entrypoint** (``container/entrypoint.sh``, runs as root before
   any process drops privilege): chowns the directory layout and sets the
   directory modes. The bash literals there must match the constants below.
2. **Process-level chmods** (this file): every Python ``chmod`` call inside
   the supervisor and brokers references the constants below, never a magic
   number. ``os.umask(_PROCESS_UMASK)`` is set at the top of each process's
   ``__main__`` so any file or directory the process creates without an
   explicit mode is also owner-only by default.

The trust split the modes encode:
- Vault contents (``.master-key``, ``creds/*.{meta,enc}``) are readable only
  by the broker UID. The agent (omnideck UID) cannot decrypt credentials
  even with full filesystem access to the rest of the container.
- Runtime sockets (``app.sock`` and per-broker sockets under ``/run/cvault/``)
  are readable + writable by the broker UID and the broker GROUP. Computron
  is in the broker group purely to connect to these sockets — nothing else.

If you change a constant here, audit ``container/entrypoint.sh`` for the
matching directory chmod and update both in lockstep.

This module also exposes :func:`disable_core_dumps`, a startup-time
hardening helper for the supervisor and brokers. Core dumps would write
the process's full memory snapshot — credentials included — to disk
where another UID could read it; setting ``RLIMIT_CORE=(0, 0)`` tells
the kernel never to generate one for this process or its children.
