"""IMAP client for the email broker.

A thin async wrapper around stdlib ``imaplib``. ``imaplib`` is synchronous and
not thread-safe; two mechanics make it work inside an asyncio broker:

- Every blocking IMAP call runs via ``asyncio.to_thread``, so the event loop
  stays responsive while a SEARCH or FETCH is in flight.
- An ``asyncio.Lock`` serializes access to the single underlying IMAP session.
  IMAP is stateful — ``SELECT <mailbox>`` locks the session to one mailbox at
  a time — so concurrent callers on different mailboxes would trip over each
  other's selected state. The lock also caches the currently-selected mailbox
  so consecutive operations on the same one skip redundant SELECT round-trips.

The client holds the credential in memory for the lifetime of the broker so it
can reconnect transparently on idle-timeout / drop. The broker's ``__main__``
wipes the credential from ``os.environ`` after handing it here; the private
attribute on this class is the only live reference for the rest of the process.
