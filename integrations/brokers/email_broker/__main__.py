"""Email broker entry point: ``python -m integrations.brokers.email_broker``.

The supervisor spawns this with credentials and policy in the environment,
reads ``READY\\n`` from stdout as the signal the broker is serving, and later
sends SIGTERM to shut it down.

Exit codes the supervisor reacts to (see ``integrations.brokers._common._exit_codes``):

- 0: clean shutdown.
- 77: IMAP LOGIN was rejected by the server. The supervisor flips the
  integration to ``auth_failed`` and does not restart.
- 1: anything else (env-parse failure, network unreachable, internal error).
  The supervisor transitions to ``error`` and restarts on backoff.

Each upstream — IMAP, SMTP, CalDAV — is brought up in turn. SMTP and CalDAV
are optional (a catalog entry without ``SMTP_HOST`` or ``CALDAV_URL`` skips
the corresponding bring-up). An auth rejection from any of them maps to exit
77 so the supervisor flips state to ``auth_failed`` and stops respawning.
