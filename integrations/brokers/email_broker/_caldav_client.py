"""CalDAV client for the email broker.

Thin async wrapper around the synchronous :mod:`caldav` library. Mirrors
the IMAP client's contract:

- Every blocking ``caldav`` call runs through ``asyncio.to_thread`` so
  the event loop stays responsive while a HTTP-PROPFIND or REPORT is in
  flight.
- An ``asyncio.Lock`` serializes access to the underlying ``DAVClient``.
  caldav's library is documented as not fully thread-safe, and serial
  access matches what we already do for IMAP.

The credential is held in memory for the broker's lifetime — same pattern
as the IMAP client. The broker's ``__main__`` wipes it from
``os.environ`` after handing it here.
