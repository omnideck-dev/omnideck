"""LLM proxy broker: inject auth header, forward HTTP traffic over a UDS.

The supervisor spawns this with credentials and provider info in the
environment. It starts an aiohttp HTTP server on a Unix Domain Socket,
validates the API key at startup, then serves as a transparent HTTP proxy
that injects the real auth header on every forwarded request.

Streaming responses (SSE / chunked transfer encoding) pass through
unmodified — the proxy writes chunks to the SDK client as they arrive
from the upstream API.

Exit codes (same contract as email_broker):
- 0: clean shutdown
- 77: API key rejected by upstream (401 / 403 on startup validation)
- 1: network unreachable or internal error
