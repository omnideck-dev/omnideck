"""Google Workspace broker entry point: ``python -m integrations.brokers.google_workspace_broker``.

The supervisor spawns this with OAuth tokens in the environment, reads
``READY\\n`` from stdout once the broker has verified the tokens by
issuing a fresh access-token refresh, and later sends SIGTERM to shut
it down.

Exit codes (see :mod:`integrations.brokers._common._exit_codes`):

- 0: clean shutdown.
- 77: refresh token rejected by Google. The supervisor flips state to
  ``auth_failed`` and stops respawning; recovery uses reconnect.
- 1: anything else (env-parse failure, network unreachable, internal error).
  Supervisor backoff applies.
