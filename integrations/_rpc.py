"""Length-prefixed JSON framing over a Unix Domain Socket.

Wire format::

    request : <4-byte BE length><JSON: {"id": n, "verb": "...", "args": {...}}>
    success : <4-byte BE length><JSON: {"id": n, "result": ...}>
    error   : <4-byte BE length><JSON: {"id": n, "error": {"code": "...", "message": "..."}}>

All brokers use this. Access control lives at the filesystem level. The socket
is created with Unix mode ``0660`` (owner rw, group rw, other nothing) and its
group is set to ``omnideck`` so the app server — which runs under that group
— can connect while any other UID sees ``EACCES`` at the kernel.
