"""Tests for tasks._executor.

Coverage gap this file addresses: the executor is the bridge between the
task scheduler and the agent runtime. It calls ``get_core_tools()``, which
is async because integrated tool gating awaits the integrations cache.
A regression that drops the ``await`` somewhere in the executor causes
``AgentState(coroutine)`` → ``TypeError: 'coroutine' object is not iterable``
at goal-run time, and goal runs fail with retry exhausted. This file's
``_build_agent`` test pins that contract so the next async-signature
change can't silently break goal execution.

    ``get_core_tools`` is an async function. ``_build_agent`` must await
    it and pass the resolved list (not the coroutine) to ``AgentState``.
    If a future change drops the ``await`` here, ``list(coroutine)``
    inside ``AgentState.__init__`` raises ``TypeError: 'coroutine'
    object is not iterable`` — the exact failure mode goal runs hit.

    We patch ``get_core_tools`` to an async stub that returns ``[]``,
    so a missing-await regression produces a coroutine handed to
    ``AgentState`` and the test fails with the same TypeError users
    would see. With the await in place, the stub resolves to ``[]``
    and the build completes.
