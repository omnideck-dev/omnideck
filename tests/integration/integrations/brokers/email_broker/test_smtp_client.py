"""Tests for ``brokers/email_broker/_smtp_client.py`` against ``fake_email``.

Same shape as ``test_imap_client.py``: a real ``FakeEmail`` SMTP server on a
random port, plain TCP (no STARTTLS — the fake doesn't speak it), and the
real ``SmtpClient`` driving it. If either side is wrong the test fails.

We pass ``starttls=False`` because the fake speaks plaintext SMTP. Production
brokers default to ``starttls=True`` (port 587 submission flow); the production
path is exercised by the end-to-end broker subprocess tests that point a real
broker at the fake with ``SMTP_STARTTLS=false`` env.
