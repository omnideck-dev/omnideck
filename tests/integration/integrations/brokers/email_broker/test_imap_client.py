"""Tests for brokers/email_broker/_imap_client.py against the fake_email fixture.

Integration-style — real TCP between stdlib ``imaplib`` (running in a worker
thread via ``asyncio.to_thread``) and ``fake_email``'s asyncio IMAP server bound
on a kernel-chosen random port. Nothing is mocked at the socket layer, so these
tests exercise both the client class and the fake in one pass; if either is
wrong, the test fails.

Each test spins up its own ``FakeEmail`` instance rather than using a pytest
fixture. Two reasons:

1. The failure-mode tests mutate server state (``reject_next_n_imap_logins``,
   etc.), so sharing an instance across tests would cross-contaminate.
2. FakeEmail is cheap to start/stop (~low ms), so the per-test cost is small
   and the test file stays explicit about the server's lifecycle.

    folder skip a SELECT round-trip. After ``_with_reconnect`` reconnects,
    the cache must reset to ``None`` — otherwise the retry's
    ``_select_in_thread`` short-circuits on the cached name and skips SELECT
    on the *new* connection, leaving SEARCH/FETCH to run against a freshly-
    LOGIN'd-but-not-SELECTed handle (server replies ``BAD: Must SELECT first``).

    The bug only manifests when the retry asks for the **same** folder that
    was cached pre-drop — a different folder always falls through the
    cache check on its own. So this test:

      1. Primes the cache on INBOX via a successful list_messages
      2. Forces a drop on the next command (the SEARCH inside the second
         list_messages call, since the cached SELECT is skipped)
      3. Asks for INBOX *again* — if the cache wasn't cleared on reconnect,
         the retry skips SELECT and SEARCH fails with BAD on the new conn.
