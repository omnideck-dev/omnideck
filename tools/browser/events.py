"""Browser tool event emission helpers.

This module provides a single ``_emit_screenshot`` function that captures a
JPEG screenshot from a Playwright page and publishes it as a
``BrowserScreenshotPayload`` event for the UI.

All screenshot emission flows funnel through ``_emit_screenshot``:

- **Progressive** — ``request_progressive_screenshot`` queues a throttled,
  non-blocking capture via ``_ScreenshotEmitter`` during interactions (mouse
  movement, typing, scrolling).
- **Post-tool** — ``emit_screenshot_after`` decorator calls
  ``_emit_screenshot`` once after a tool returns a result with a page view.
- **Ad-hoc** — ``javascript.py`` calls ``emit_screenshot`` directly after
  JS evaluation.
