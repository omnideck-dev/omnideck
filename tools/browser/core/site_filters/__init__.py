"""Site-specific node filters for the DOM pipeline.

Pluggable filters that prune noise from known sites, letting the LLM
focus on actionable content.  Each filter receives and returns a flat
``list[DomNode]`` — the same shape the rest of the pipeline passes around.

To add a new site filter, create a module in this package with a public
``filter_<site>(nodes)`` function, then register it in ``_SITE_FILTERS``.
