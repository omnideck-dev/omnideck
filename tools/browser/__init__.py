"""Browser tools package.

Important: the browser used by these tools is long-lived within the process
and maintains browser state between tool calls. This includes cookies,
localStorage/sessionStorage, open pages/tabs, and other session-specific
state. Call ``close_browser`` (or restart the process) to fully reset the
browser and clear that state when needed.

Public API:
- goto: Navigate a tab to a URL (creates the first tab if none exist).
- new_tab: Open a new tab at a URL.
- close_tab: Close a tab; its ID is not reused.
- browse_page: Browse the current page (no navigation) with ``[role] name``
  markers for interactive elements.  Optional ``scope`` parameter to focus
  on a specific section.
- read_page: Read the current page as clean markdown text for reading
  articles, documentation, or search results.
- click, fill_field, press_keys, select_option, scroll_page, go_back, drag:
  Interaction tools that return a formatted page view string.
- inspect_page: Visually inspect the current page and answer a question about it.
- browser_visual_action: Ask a vision model to decide and execute the next GUI
  action (click, type, scroll, drag, etc.).
- execute_javascript: Execute arbitrary JavaScript for advanced scenarios (use sparingly;
  prefer structured tools like click, fill_field for reliability).
- close_browser: Cleanly close the persistent Playwright browser.
