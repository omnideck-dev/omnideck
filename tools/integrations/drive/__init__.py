"""Unified agent tools for Drive integrations (Google Drive and iCloud Drive).

All tools take an opaque ``handle`` string. For Google Drive, handles are
``id:<file_id>`` and survive renames/moves. For rclone-backed remotes (iCloud
Drive), handles are POSIX-style paths from the remote root. ``drive_list``
returns the handle alongside each entry's name, so the agent never has to
know which format it's looking at.

Read tools (``drive_list``, ``drive_search``, ``drive_download``) require
DRIVE read access; the rest require DRIVE read+write. ``drive_share`` is
Google-only and is only registered on integrations whose broker supports it.
