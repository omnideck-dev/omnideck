        Build goals using: begin_goal → add_task (once per task) → commit_goal.

        Each add_task call returns the updated draft — pass it into the next call.
        By default each task depends on the previous one (sequential). Pass
        depends_on=[] to run a task in parallel with no dependencies.

        Completed dependency results are automatically appended to a task's
        instruction at execution time — do not use template syntax like {{key}}.

        AGENT PROFILES — each task can specify an agent_profile to configure
        the executing agent's model, skills, system prompt, and inference params:
        - "code_expert": coder skill, low temp, thinking enabled
        - "research_agent": browser + coder skills, medium temp
        - "creative_writer": high temp, top_p sampling
        - Omit agent_profile for the default Omnideck agent

        Task instructions must be fully self-contained — include all URLs, file
        paths, criteria, and output expectations. The executing agent has no
        other context.

        Use list_goals to see existing goals and list_tasks to inspect a goal's
        tasks. Use trigger_goal to manually run or re-run a goal.
